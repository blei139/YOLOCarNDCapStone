# YOLOCarNDCapStone
Everything is the same as our self-driving car team effort except the Traffic Light object detection is using YOLO.
Since YOLO has higher bounding box accuracy, bounding exactly around the traffic light more often than SSD, I will try 
to use YOLO traffic light object detection, just for testing it in our Udacity simulator.
